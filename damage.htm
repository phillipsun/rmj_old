              ><b>Damage to Property -</b> In the unlikely event that our crews
              damage your property in any way, please contact us immediately so
              we can make timely, professional repairs. In most cases in the
              past, any damage has been minor.&nbsp; Broken sprinkler heads are
              the most common damage because they are often difficult or
              impossible to see in the grass. We will fix them if we break them,
              but if you are continually having problems with them getting hit,
              they are probably wearing out and sticking in the up position
              after watering or they aren’t set at the right height.&nbsp; If
              this is the case, please call a sprinkler company out to check
              your system – if the sprinkler heads are working properly and are
              set at the proper height, they won’t be damaged by our equipment.
